AB  - Pollution from current and past mining is a significant problem in several parts of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Water from six different mining areas in Macedonia was analysed to assess the effects of metalliferous mining activities. Drainage sediments at all locations show evidence of physical and chemical contamination; water compositions, however, were more variable. Low pH water associated with mining has led to the dissolution of minerals and the mobilization of metals from the ores and the host rocks. Only Sb was noted to exhibit enhanced mobility in higher pH waters. The Zletevo Pb-Zn mine discharges low pH water that has high levels of several metals, including Al, Zn, Cd, and Fe; sediment concentrations are grossly elevated for several km downstream. Toranica and Sasa Pb-Zn mines exhibit similar sediment contamination of Pb, Zn, Cd, and other ore-related metals. However, concentrations of metals in waters are far lower at both of these mines, due to less pyrite in the ore and the buffering of the acid waters by carbonate host lithologies. At the Buchim copper mine, waters are both acidic and high in dissolved solids; Cu concentrations exceed 100 mg/L. Krstov Dol and Alshar are small, disused As-Sb mines that discharge waters that exceed potable values for some contaminants (e. g. As), but this may be related to the mineralization of the bedrock rather than the mines. In general, metal concentrations decreased downstream from the source due to dilution from other rivers and coprecipitation of metals on other mineral phases (e. g. Fe-, Al- and Mn-oxides, and hydroxides).

AB  - Elevated levels of heavy metals in the aquatic and soil systems can be caused by the weathering of mineralized rocks. This enrichment is often considerably enlarged by historical and current mining and smelting activities. In Poland, the most contaminated river systems are those in the Silesia region. The metalliferous ore mining and smelting industries have been the main sources of heavy metal pollutions over the last 100–170 years. The previous and present studies have shown very high concentrations of heavy metals in the bottom sediments of the Mala Panew River, the most polluted tributary of the Oder River. The main objective of this work was to study temporary changes of selected metal (Zn, Pb, and Cd) concentrations in upper layer of bottom sediments at the measuring point near the outlet of the Mala Panew River into the Oder River, and to determine the vertical distribution of the metals in the sediment cores from the most polluted middle part of this river. The mobility of the metals and their potential bioavailability were assessed based on metal partitioning in the sediments and metal concentrations in pore waters. The presented data were compared with metal concentrations in aquatic sediments from similar historical mining and smelting sites in Poland and other countries.

AB  - A preliminary survey of the benthic fauna of sites on the Nent system affected by elevated zinc levels, acid water and organic enrichment is described. Data on faunal composition are presented for 17 sites. A clustering technique was applied to the taxa/site matrix to demonstrate the degree of association between sites varying in zinc concentration. Chandler biotic scores were found to be lowest at sites affected by high zinc levels and/or dense growths of the alga Stigeoclonium tenue. The role of elevated zinc levels and algal growth in determining the diversity and abundance of benthos is discussed.

AB  - The macroinvertebrate fauna of the river Nent, a heavy metal polluted upland stream in northern England, first surveyed in 1976, was re‐examined in 2004 to assess long‐term changes in relation to activities in the catchment which have included, a river restoration project, works associated with the development of a mine heritage site and the removal of a chicken farm and more effective organic pollution control measures. The degree of change between years in total abundance, numbers of taxa and community composition varied considerably between sites. Two tributary sites showed marked changes between years due to a reduction in acidity in one and changed substratum in the other but in the main river no significant difference in total taxa and total abundance was observed between years, although seasonal differences were significant. Multivariate community analyses grouped 1976 samples with those taken in 2004 but revealed a clear separation between upper and lower Nent sites. This observed difference may be related to increased algal cover in the lower sites in conjunction with geomorphological features of the lower Nent. Environmental assessment methodology River Invertebrate Prediction and Classification System (RIVPACS) identified ‘sensitive’ faunal groups and indicated that the extensive impact of zinc pollution in the main river has remained practically the same between 1976 and 2004. This persistence of community structure despite the heavily disturbed nature of the river is attributed to relative constancy in instream habitat conditions. The recent activities in the catchment have had little effect on the overall controllers of faunal communities in this system, zinc concentrations and geomorphological characteristics of the stream. However, further disturbances involving movement of spoil heaps and channel alterations in the upper catchment may increase both sediment and heavy metal loadings to the river.

AB  - The past two decades have witnessed an increase in the exploration for, and development of, mineral resources at Arctic latitudes. Such effort has resulted in the commencement of production at a number of different localities in close proximity to the ocean. Since proximity to a source of transportation for the conveyance of concentrates to the market is a primary requirement governing the economic decisions for the mine to proceed, it is logical that ore deposits near a coastline are primary targets for development. Closely tied to coastal mining developments is the need to dispose of tailings and waste rock in the most economical manner. Prior to the advent of heightened public awareness and environmental concern, and the enactment of pollution legislation, disposal practices were largely based upon convenience. Currently, however, proposed disposal and operating practices receive closer scrutiny, with a view to providing adequate protection for aquatic resources and habitat. This paper summarizes some of the features of three Arctic mines, wastes from which enter the marine environment, and compares the disposal practices used at each to measures of environmental change as indicated by metal concentrations in various media.

AB  - Extractive industry in Arctic is controversial due  to the ecosystems and communities in the region are highly sensitive to natural and anthropogenic disturbances as it is one of the world’s global change hot-spots, as well as its uniqueness and distinctive social and ecological significance. As mining industry has developed into sophisticated operations, yet the basic causes of environmental pollution and degradation and impacts on the natural environment of the Arctic region remain unchanged. Mining in this environment may be faced with dilemmas as the result of adverse impacts they may cause and their escalating environmental footprints;  as well as reactions from pressure groups and indigenous peoples, which in turn may have a detrimental effect on their reputations and financial performances. This may further have social, environmental and political risks in their present and future roles and operations. Thus, the mining industry ought to recognize the impacts in their operations, and are required to work towards minimizing the adverse impacts and maximizing the substantial benefits of their actions on the environment, the community and local people. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability are supposed to be two of several principles used to examine the social and environmental endeavours and results of business activity.



The aim of this thesis is to assess the environmental and social impacts associated with major mining operations Arctic region, and to conduct preliminary review of the perspectives of CSR and sustainable development in countries across the Arctic region and subarctic, especially the United States of America (USA), Finland and Sweden. As well as conduct comparative study and analysis on how corporate entities in these countries dealing with the two theoretical frameworks and how they are approached in practice and managed, and information are disclosed. The study also concentrates on how these issues can be handled in the case of Jokkmokk (Kallak) Iron Mines in Sweden. Different methodological approaches and techniques have been adopted in this study. The literature review is supplemented by interviews with strategically important stakeholders. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) statement is reviewed and conceptual modeling is also employed to demonstrate the dynamic effects and consequences of the Kallak North Iron Mines. The findings in this thesis propose that the corporations’ in the USA show differences from those of the European countries in defining and  addressing social and environmental concerns; as well as managing CSR and sustainability issues and communicating them as there are qualitatively different practices and approaches to CSR in these countries. In conclusion, main points are suggested as important recommendations entailing of some clear expectations to fulfill on how CSR and sustainability issues may be handled by extractive industry including the case of Jokkmokk (Kallak North) Iron Mines.

AB  - Not all water from coal or metal mines is acidic. Circum-neutral or alkaline mine drainage may be due to: (i) a low content of sulphide minerals; (ii) the presence of monosulphides rather than pyrite or marcasite; (iii) a large pyrite grain-size limiting oxidation rate; (iv) neutralization of acid by carbonate or basic silicate minerals; (v) engineering factors (introduction of lime dust for explosion prevention; cement or rock flour during construction works); (vi) neutralization of acid by naturally highly alkaline groundwaters; (vii) circulating water not coming into effective contact with sulphide minerals; and (viii) oxygen not coming into direct contact with sulphide minerals or influent water being highly reducing.

AB  - The Raglan mine in Nunavik, in the province of Quebec, and Voisey's Bay mine in Nunatsiavut, in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, are important drivers of economic development in their respective regions. Existing studies and data concerning the economic impacts of extractive industries are concentrated on the national or regional impacts, and do not assess the impacts on business and human development at the local and community level. The article analyzes the impacts of the Raglan Mine and the Voisey's Bay Mine on business development and employment in Nunavik and Nunatsiavut respectively. The article presents the design, methodology, and results of a three-year study in which focus groups and surveys were conducted with business owners. We report on the views and experiences of business owners with respect to how mining has impacted local business development. We evaluate some community employment trends, identify policy insights, and recommend future research directions to improve the utilization of mining benefits by local Indigenous communities and Indigenous governments.

AB  - Samples of old silver mine dump materials, garden soils contaminated with mine dump materials, noncontaminated garden soils, and vegetation grown in these gardens were collected to determine the extent of Pb, Cd, and Zn contamination in Aspen, CO.  Total HNO3-HCIO4-HF-soluble and NH4HCO3-DTPA (AB-DTPA)-extractable metals in mine dump materials and soils, respectively, were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICPS).  Plant samples were diegested with HNO3 and analyzed by ICPS.  Total metals ranged from 135 to 21 700 mg kg-1 Pb, from 13.3 to 223 mg kg-1 Cd, and from 144 to 20 000 mg kg-1 Zn in mine dump materials.  The AB-DTPA-extractable metals ranged from 9.2 to 808 mg kg-1 Pb, from 0.2 to 14.2 mg kg-1 Cd, and from 8.4 to 484 mg kg-1 Zn in garden soils.  Many of the mine dump materials and soils contained sufficient quantities of Pb and Cd to pose potential health risks if the contaminated materials were ingested.  Plant tissues were sampled from the above gardens.  In general, leafy tissue concentrations of Pb, Cd, and Zn were highest.  Root and other tuber crops were intermediate, lower than leaves, but higher than fruits.  The range of concentrations of metals in the leafy tissues were from < 5.0 to 45 mg kg-1 for Pb, from 0.6 to 11.9 mg kg-1 Cd, and from 16 to 444 mg kg-1 for Zn.  In the roots, metals ranged from < 5.0 to 12 mg kg-1 Pb, from 0.5 to 3.6 mg kg-1 Cd, and from 19 to 150 mg kg-1 Zn.  Vegetable fruits contained < 5.0 mg kg-1 Pb, from < 0.5 to 2.7 mg kg-1 Cd, and from 46 to 107 mg kg-1 Zn.  Members of the species Brassica oleracea did not accumulate Pb in leaves, even when grown on highly contaminated soils, but accumated Cd and Zn.  It was concluded that old mine dump materials have contaminated garden soils placed on them with Pb, Cd, and Zn.  The contaminated material poses a health hazard, especially for children.  These potential health risks caused the USEPA to list the site on the National Priority List (Superfund sites).  The USEPA has completed its REMEDIAL INVESTIGATION/FEASIBILITY STUDY of Aspen mine dumps and has scheduled implementation of remedial action (clean up) to begin in 1991.

AB  - Nunavut has gained importance in the last few years as an area of high mineral potential with exploration leading to discoveries of several mineral deposits that have, or will in the coming years, become mines. As a territory with an economy based in large part on government employment, new mining operations have the potential to provide Nunavut with an alternative way to develop its economy through job creation, local business opportunities, royalties, and taxes. Mining could provide the people of Nunavut with training opportunities for various jobs that can later be used for employment with community-based businesses. Understanding the socio-economic impacts of past Arctic mining operations, such as the Polaris and Nanisivik Mines, is important if these opportunities are to become reality and if Nunavut is to benefit as much as possible from future mining operations.



The Polaris and Nanisivik lead-zinc mines closed in 2002 after over 20 years of operation. Each mine was located near an Inuit community: Polaris, situated 100 km northwest of Resolute, was a fly-in/fly-out operation that used Resolute as a staging point; and Nanisivik was a community-based operation connected to Arctic Bay by a 21 km-long all-weather road. The differences between the physical connections of the mines to Inuit communities provide a good opportunity to compare and contrast their socio-economic impacts on each community.



This qualitative study uses company and government reports and the data from 51 interviews, conducted over a 4-week period in January–February 2005 with residents of Resolute and Arctic Bay, to learn how current and future mining in Nunavut might better establish long-lasting, positive socio-economic benefits according to current sustainable development practices (Bowes-Lyon 2006).



The results reveal that community members believe the mines had some positive short-term impacts, but few lasting benefits. Positive economic impacts included the creation of new businesses and jobs at the mines, with resulting increased incomes; however, many of these benefits disappeared after mine closure. Positive social impacts were restricted to better education opportunities at the Nanisivik school, whereas negative impacts included increased alcohol consumption. The benefits of employment were mixed because, although employment was available to local Inuit, training was limited and did not in general lead to any certification that could be transfered to other jobs after mine closure.



Overall, it is concluded that because the benefits were not numerous and mostly did not persist after mine closure these mines did not contribute to the long-term sustainable development of the region. To increase socio-economic benefits and assist communities with fulfilling their sustainable development objectives, mining companies in Nunavut should emphasize education and training for locals and encourage local business development and partnerships, through strong relationships and close communication with involved stakeholders.

A critical examination is made of Lucas's model of youth to maturity in community development, and a further two stages are suggested ‐ winding down and closure of a town. The discussion centres on the characteristics of community and corporate winding down in Schefferville: the restructuring of the local workforce, disinvestment, relocation of capital, and company withdrawal from housing, municipal affairs, and public services.

AB  - As an extension of an earlier study covering the 8-year period 1965-71 (t1), the incidence of cancer in black gold miners over a second 8-year period, 1972-79 (t2) has been investigated. The population again totalled 2.9 million man-years of employment, an average of 363,800 men per year. Of the 903 cancers found in t2, primary liver cancer accounted for 45.4%, oesophageal cancer 19.8%, cancer of the respiratory system 11.2% and bladder cancer 2.7%. Analysis of these 4 common cancers by country or region of origin of the miners confirms for the most part the patterns of incidence found in the earlier survey and consolidated rates are therefore presented for the full 16-year period, 1964-79 (t3). The spatial distribution of primary liver cancer within Mozambique and oesphageal cancer within Transkei have been investigated for the periods t1, t2 and t3 and temporal changes of rate have been examined by individual years from 1964 to 1979. The geographical gradient of incidence for cancer of the oesophagus in Transkei has become less marked during the second period of the survey and the crude incidence rate for primary liver cancer in gold miners from Mozambique has continued to drop throughout the period of the survey.

AB  - Concern has surfaced over the recent discovery of human mercury exposure throughout the tropical rain forest of South America's Amazon River Basin. The probable source of mercury has been traced to gold mines located within the interior. The mining process involves the extraction of gold from ore by burning off a mercury additive, resulting in vaporization of elemental mercury into the surrounding environment. The purpose of this case series is to document mercury levels in miners and local villagers presenting with a history of exposure, or signs and symptoms consistent with mercury toxicity. Over a five year period (1986-91), the whole blood and urine mercury levels of 55 Brazilian patients demonstrating signs and symptoms consistent with mercury exposure were collected. Thirty-three (60%) of the subjects had direct occupational exposure to mercury via gold mining and refining. Whole blood mercury levels ranged from 0.4-13.0 micrograms/dL (mean 3.05 micrograms/dL). Spot urine levels ranged 0-151 micrograms/L (mean = 32.7 micrograms/L). Occupational mercury exposure is occurring in the Amazon River Basin. Interventions aimed at altering the gold mining process while protecting the workers and surrounding villagers from the source of exposure are essential. The impact of the gold mining industry on general environmental contamination has not been investigated.

AB  - Voles and small passerine birds were live-captured near the Delong Mountain Regional Transportation System (DMTS) haul road in Cape Krusenstern National Monument in northwest Alaska to assess metals exposure and sub-lethal biological effects. Similar numbers of animals were captured from a reference site in southern Cape Krusenstern National Monument for comparison. Histopathological examination of selected organs, and analysis of cadmium, lead, and zinc concentrations in liver and blood samples were performed. Voles and small birds captured from near the haul road had about 20 times greater blood and liver lead concentrations and about three times greater cadmium concentrations when compared to those from the reference site, but there were no differences in zinc tissue concentrations. One vole had moderate metastatic mineralization of kidney tissue, otherwise we observed no abnormalities in internal organs or DNA damage in the blood of any of the animals. The affected vole also had the greatest liver and blood Cd concentration, indicating that the lesion might have been caused by Cd exposure. Blood and liver lead concentrations in animals captured near the haul road were below concentrations that have been associated with adverse biological effects in other studies; however, subtle effects resulting from lead exposure, such as the suppression of the activity of certain enzymes, cannot be ruled out for some individual animals. Results from our 2006 reconnaissance-level study indicate that overall, voles and small birds obtained from near the DMTS road in Cape Krusenstern National Monument were not adversely affected by metals exposure; however, because of the small sample size and other uncertainties, continued monitoring of lead and cadmium in terrestrial habitats near the DMTS road is advised.

AB  - Levels of HIV infection are particularly high amongst migrant workers in sub-Saharan Africa. This paper presents a case study of one such vulnerable group of migrants-underground workers on the South African gold mines-and highlights the psychosocial context of HIV transmission in the mining setting. On the assumption that social identities serve as an important influence on peoples' sexual behaviour, the study examines the way in which miners construct their social identities within the parameters of their particular living and working conditions. It also identifies some of the key narratives used by miners to make sense of their experience in the realms of health, ill-health, HIV and sexuality. Masculinity emerged as a leading narrative in informants' accounts of their working life, health and sexuality, and the paper examines the way in which the construction of masculine identities renders miners particularly vulnerable to HIV. The implications of these findings for HIV educational interventions are discussed.

AB  - 22 of 31 residents of a Somerset village where soil levels of cadmium were high had raised blood-cadmium levels, and some had clinical and biochemical findings (including hypertension and biochemical evidence of renal tubular damage) indicating toxic effects which could be attributed to the metal. It is suggested that more detailed studies should be carried out as a matter of urgency and that advice on avoiding local garden produce and not smoking should be emphasised. Probably more serious, however, is the summation effect with industrial exposure.

AB  - Starting from a cross-sectional survey in 1973, the mortality of two cohorts of Sardinian metal miners was followed through December 31, 1988. In mine A, the quartz concentration in respirable dust ranged between 0.2% and 2.0% and the exposure to radon daughters averaged 0.13 working level (WL), with the highest estimated cumulative exposure around 80-120 WLM. In mine B, the silica content was much higher (6.529%), but exposure to radon daughters was significantly lower than in mine A. More than 98% of the overall work force in 1973 (1,741 miners) entered the cohort, providing 25,842.5 person-years. Smoking, occupational history, chest radiographs, and lung function tests were available for the cohort members at admission. Mortality for all causes was slightly lower than expected. A significant excess for nonmalignant chronic respiratory diseases was noticed in both mines. Twenty-four subjects died of lung cancer, 17 from mine A (SMR: 128; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 75-205) and 7 from mine B (SMR: 85; 95% CI: 34-175). The SMR for lung cancer was highest among the underground workers from mine A (SMR: 148; 95% CI: 74-265), with a significant upward trend by duration of employment in underground jobs. Mine B underground miners showed lung cancer SMRs close to 100 without a significant trend by duration of employment. Among underground miners with spirometric airways obstruction in 1973, those from mine A showed the highest risk (SMR: 316; 95% CI: 116-687). The relationship did not change after adjusting for age and smoking.

Based on the present findings, crystalline silica per se does not appear to affect lung cancer mortality. A slight association between lung cancer mortality and exposure to radon daughters, though within relatively low levels, may be considered for underground miners from mine A.

Impaired pulmonary function may be an independent predictor of lung cancer and an important risk factor enhancing the residence time of inhaled carcinogens, i.e., alpha particles or PAHs, by impairing their bronchial and alveolar clearance. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pathway of leaded dust from a lead-zinc-copper mine to houses of employees, and the impact on blood lead concentrations (PbB) of children. METHODS: High precision lead isotope and lead concentration data were obtained on venous blood and environmental samples (vacuum cleaner dust, interior dustfall accumulation, water, paint) for eight children of six employees (and the employees) from a lead-zinc-copper mine. These data were compared with results for 11 children from occupationally unexposed control families living in the same city. RESULTS: The median (range) concentrations of lead in vacuum cleaner dust was 470 (21-1300) ppm. In the houses of the mine employees, vacuum cleaner dust contained varying higher proportions of mine lead than did airborne particulate matter measured as dustfall accumulated over a three month period. The median (range) concentrations of lead in soil were 30 (5-407) ppm and these showed no evidence of any mine lead. Lead in blood of the mine employees varied from 7 to 25 micrograms/dl and was generally dominated by mine lead (> 60%). The mean (SD) PbB in the children of the mine employees was 5.7 (1.7) micrograms/dl compared with 4.1 (1.4) micrograms/dl for the control children (P = 0.02). The PbB of all children was always < 10 micrograms/dl, the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council goal for all Australians. Some of the control children had higher PbB than the children of mine employees, probably from exposure to leaded paint as six of the eight houses of the control children were > 50 years old. In five of the eight children of mine employees > 20% of PbB was from the lead mine. However, in the other three cases of children of mine employees, their PbB was from sources other than mine lead (paint, petrol, background sources). CONCLUSIONS: Houses of employees from a lead mine can be contaminated by mine lead even if they are not situated in the same place as the mine. Delineation of the mine to house pathway indicates that lead is probably transported into the houses on the clothes, shoes, hair, skin, and in some cases, motor vehicles of the workers. In one case, dust shaken from clothes of a mine employee contained 3000 ppm lead which was 100% mine lead. The variable contamination of the houses was not expected given the precautions taken by mine employees to minimise transportation of lead into their houses. Although five out of the eight children of mine employees had > 20% mine lead in their blood, in no case did the PbB of a child exceed the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council goal of 10 micrograms/dl. In fact, some children in the control families had higher PbB than children of mine employees. In two cases, this was attributed to a pica habit for paint. The PbB in the children of mine employees and controls was independent of the source of lead. The low PbB in the children of mine employees may reflect the relatively low solubility (bioavailability) of the mine dust in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid (< 40 %), behaviour--for example, limited mouthing activity--or diet.

AB  - A hydrogeochemical survey was carried out in the Fluminese district (SW Sardinia, Italy) to investigate the impact of past mining activities on the aquatic system. Waters in the Fluminese are near-neutral to slightly
alkaline. Mine drainages had the highest SO4 (640 mg/L), Zn (40 mg/L) and Cd (97 µg/L); other metals show a wide range in concentrations depending on dominant mineral assemblages at each mine. Dissolved Pb in mine waters is in the range of 1 to 53 µg/L but Pb > 10 µg/L also occurs in spring and well waters. The metal load discharged daily into the sea under low-flow condition is estimated at about 2160 g for Zn, 21 g for Cd and 30 g for Pb.

AB  - Fourhorn sculpins (Myoxocephalus quadricornis) and shorthorn sculpins (Myoxocephalus scorpius) have been considered suitable local bioindicators for environmental monitoring studies in the Arctic. Because these species share many characteristics, data from the two species have previously been pooled when assessing marine metal contamination. A chemical and histological study was conducted on fourhorn and shorthorn sculpins collected around a contaminated lead-zinc mine at East Greenland to investigate whether there were any differences in the residues of metals, histopathology and parasites in liver and gills between the two sculpin species. The results demonstrated that concentrations of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) were significantly higher in the fourhorn sculpins (p < 0.001) while there were no significant differences for arsenic (As) or cadmium (Cd). Furthermore, density of blood vessel fibrosis (p=0.028), prevalence and density of chondroplasia (p=0.002 and p=0.005, respectively), number of mucin-containing mucous cells (p < 0.001) and chloride cells (p < 0.001) and mean intensity of colonial Peritricha (p < 0.001) were significantly higher in fourhorn sculpin. Based on these results we suggest that pooling the two species when conducting environmental assessments is not recommended as it can lead to incorrect conclusions. We propose that a larger study investigating the biological effects of zinc-lead mining in Greenland is needed.

AB  - A 2 x 2 km grid survey of surface soils was conducted over 600 km of North Somerset, England, to investigate the role of pollution from former base metal mines on soil heavy metal content.  Soil contents of Pb, Zn, Cu and Cd were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry after extraction in hot, concentrated nitric acid.  Most of the soils were contaminated by lead, zinc and cadmium.  Isoline maps and perspective block diagrams showed this contamination to be most severe on the Mendip plateau, especially in the vicinity of Shipham, Wells and Priddy districts.  Resurgences, polluted from mine drainage, also contaminated soils at the base of the Mendip slopes and, over the lowlands, trace element enriched Liassic shales caused significant local anomalies.

AB  - This paper reports an investigation of environmental Pb pollution by wind blown material from a spoil heap at a derelict Pb mine in West Wales. Most of the <2 mm fraction of the spoil is of sufficiently small particle diameter to move by saltation and the material <2 μm probably approximates to the composition of PbS. Meteorological data for 1977/1978 were analysed. During dry weather northerly winds predominate and these are probably funnelled in an east-west direction by the valley in which the mine is situated. It is calculated that the spoil can be set moving by winds of Force 4 or greater and such winds were experienced for 193 days in the reference year. Atmospheric transport of Pb-rich dust was monitored by moss bags and Pb isoline maps were constructed from the data. There is a marked movement of dust westwards from the spoil heap to nearly 1800 m down the valley. A survey of Pb in soil revealed a characteristic east-west alignment of the Pb isolines which suggests that air-borne dust is the major source of pollution. Pb in unwashed lettuce leaves was some 5 times greater than in washed leaves while the latter contained Pb in excess of the British legal limit. Pb in domestic water was not a problem. It is concluded that blowing spoil is an immediate environmental hazard through deposition on plant leaves and through inhalation by people or animals. Pb which has accumulated in the soil may present a dietary problem.

AB  - The production of gold in Brazil can be associated with changes in the environment and an increase in the amount of work-related accidents and diseases, one of which is the effect of the exposure to mercury. This is due to a large increase in the production of gold, to mercury's toxicity, and to the great number of people exposed to the metal. In the last 20 years, gold production in Brazil has grown at a very fast pace until 1990. In 1972, the amount of gold produced in the country was 9.6 tons, and in 1988 it was nearly 218.6 tons (Felix, 1987; Hasse, 1993). Because gold is found in a powdered form, the use of mercury is necessary to form a mercury/ gold amalgam to make the extraction easier, normally at a 1/1 proportion. Thus for each kilogram of gold, an average of one kilogram of mercury is used. This proportion may vary from 0.8-1.3 (Pfeiffer, 1988; Couto, Camara and Sabrosa, 1988; Ferreira and Appel, 1990). In 1989 alone, mercury imports reached 339.9 tons (Hasse, 1993).

AB  - Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn were measured in vegetables in Xiguadi village around Lechang Pb/Zn mine in Guangdong province, South China. The daily intake (DI) of these metals from vegetables by local people was also determined. The respective Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn concentration was 0.05-0.90 (mean 0.25), 1.04-5.82 (2.64), 0.53-7.07 (2.00) and 3.87-25.20 (11.68) mg kg(-1), of which Cd concentration in all vegetables exceeded the safe limit given by FAO/WHO. The DI was found to be 49.76, 475.56, 360.36 and 2,102.63 mu g, respectively. The present results indicated local mining activity caused vegetable heavy metal contamination and Cd concentration exceeding the stipulated standards for all vegetables indicating potentially serious dietary risks for local people.

AB  - The risk of heat exhaustion at a deep underground metalliferous mine was assessed in relation to the body-mass index (BMI) and predicted maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) of miners, using case-control methodology. Sixty-five cases of acute heat exhaustion and 119 controls were studied. Heat exhaustion cases had a significantly higher BMI than controls (P = 0.006). The odds ratios increased with BMI. For a BMI of 32.00-36.99, compared to a BMI of less than 27.00 the odds ratio was 3.63 (95% confidence interval, 1.42-9.36). VO2max was not significantly lower in cases than controls. The odds ratios for heat exhaustion increased with decreasing VO2max, but not significantly. The sample size provided 80% power of detecting an odds ratio of 2.5 or greater. Deep underground miners should be advised to maintain a BMI of 24-27. Selection of miners on the basis of BMI should not be used as an alternative to satisfactory engineering controls such as ventilation and refrigeration.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recently conducted a cross-sectional study during gold mining operations near El Callao, Venezuela. The purpose of the study was to assess mercury exposures and mercury-related microdamage to the kidneys. The study consisted of concurrent occupational hygiene and biological monitoring, and an examination of the processing techniques employed at the different mining facilities. Mercury was used in these facilities to remove gold by forming a mercury-gold amalgam. The gold was purified either by heating the amalgam in the open with a propane torch or by using a small retort. METHODS: Thirty-eight workers participated in this study. Some participants were employed by a large mining company, while others were considered "informal miners" (self-employed). Mercury exposure was monitored by sampling air from the workers' breathing zones. These full-shift air samples were used to calculate time-weighted average (TWA) mercury exposure concentrations. A questionnaire was administered and a spot urine sample was collected. Each urine sample was analyzed for mercury, creatinine, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG). RESULTS: The range for the 8-h TWA airborne mercury exposure concentrations was 0.1 to 6,315 micrograms/m3, with a mean of 183 micrograms/m3. Twenty percent of the TWA airborne mercury exposure measurements were above the NIOSH recommended exposure limit (REL) of 50 micrograms/m3, and 26% exceeded the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) threshold limit value (TLV) of 25 micrograms/m3. The mean urine mercury concentration was 101 micrograms/g creatinine (microgram/g-Cr), and the data ranged from 2.5 to 912 micrograms/g-Cr. Forty-two percent of the study participants had urine mercury concentrations that exceeded the ACGIH biological exposure index (BEI) of 35 micrograms/g-Cr. Urinary NAG excretion is considered a biological marker of preclinical, nonspecific microdamage to the kidney's proximal tubule cells. The mean urine NAG concentration was 3.6 International Units/g-Cr (IU/g-Cr) with a range of 0.5 to 11.5 IU/g-Cr. Three workers had urine NAG levels in excess of the reference values. Correlation analyses found statistically significant correlations between airborne mercury exposure and urine mercury level (P = 0.01), and between urine mercury level and urine NAG excretion (P = 0.01). In addition, the airborne mercury exposure data and urine mercury data were segregated by job tasks. A Wilcoxon rank sum test revealed significant correlations between tasks and mercury exposure (P = 0.03), and between tasks and urine mercury level (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The tasks with the highest mean airborne mercury exposures were "burning the mercury-gold amalgam" and "gold refining/smelting". Recommendations were provided for improving the retort design to better contain mercury, for ventilation in the gold shops, and for medical surveillance and educational programs.

AB  - Mines, smelters, power plants and other industries are sources of metal emissions to the Upper Silesia environment.  The ranges of concentrations of the primary metallic contaminants in the arable soils of the region are broad (in mg/kg, dry wt.):  Cd 0.1-143.0; Pb 4-8,200; Zn 5-13,250.  The geometric means of concentrations of these elements in the soils are as follows (in mg/kg, dry wt.):  Cd 3.2; Pb 102.3; and Zn 270.2.  Only 10% of the arable land has natural concentrations of the trace metals, that is concentrations up to 0.6, 25, 100 mg/kg for Cd, Pb, and Zn, respectively, and about 60% of the soils have concentrations of Cd and Zn higher than critical values (Cd 2 mg/kg, Zn 200 mg/kg).  Concentrations of Pb exceeded the critical level (100 mg/kg) in about 45% of the studied soils.  Cereals and potatoes produced in the Tarnowskie Gory region, the most contaminated area of Upper Silesia, are contaminated with Cd, Pb and Zn.  About 95% of the cereal and all potato samples had Cd concentrations higher than limit level in food (0.1 mg/kg).  However, only 25% and 20% of cereal grain and potato tubers (peeled), respectively exceeded the metal limit in forage (0.5 mg/kg).  Contamination of the crops with Pb and Zn is of smaller importance because concentrations of these metals in the cereals and potatoes are usually within ranges tolerated by animals.

AB  - Investigations of environmental exposure to lead were performed in 1028 children from a very polluted industrial region affected by emissions from the lead mine and smelter plant "Orzeł Biały". A group of 629 children was used as the reference population from non-polluted parts of Poland. The lead blood concentrations in exposed groups of children were considerably higher than in the reference group and 26% of younger children and 11% of older children exceeded the safe limit value of 20 micrograms/dl. Children with the highest health risk in which Pb-B amounted to 40-50 micrograms/dl (4.2% of exposed children) were recommended for immediate medical examination. As preventive measures, improvement of hygienic life conditions and frequent trips of exposed children to non-polluted areas, were recommended which should decrease the internal lead dose.

AB  - Disposal of sulfidic waste in marine environments implies an environmental risk due to potential release and spreading of heavy metals to sediments and biota on a regional scale. However, tailings disposal in marine systems is practised in several places. Fiord sediments near Black Angel Mine in West Greenland are contaminated by Pb and Zn as a result of mining activity and marine disposal in the period 1973-1990. Chemical analyses were performed on 6 fiord sediment cores collected up to 10 km away from the disposal area and included heavy metal analysis, high-resolution stable Pb isotope stratigraphy and radiochemical dating (Pb-210). The results were used for evaluating spatial and temporal distribution of anthropogenic heavy metals from the marine disposal. A significant accumulation of Pb and Zn on a regional scale is still observed 9 years after mine closure. Stable Pb-isotope data provide a unique fingerprint of the mining-related Pb sources in the area. Today spreading of mining-related Pb up to 10 km away from the mining area accounts for more than 80% of total Pb in sediment deposited within the last 100 years. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Sulphidic mine waste disposed in marine environments constitutes an environmental risk to aquatic life due to potential uptake and accumulation of heavy metals in biota. Fiord sediments near the former Black Angel Mine in West Greenland are contaminated by lead and zinc as a result of submarine tailings disposal in 1973–1990. In 1999 cores were taken up to 10 km away from the disposal area. Analyses include heavy metals, radiochemical dating (210Pb) and high-resolution foraminiferal stratigraphy. The mining operation resulted in significant changes in the assemblage composition. In addition, up to 20% of the Melonis barleeanus population found in sediment deposited during nearby tailings disposal was deformed compared to a natural background of less than 5%. Throughout cores representing the last 100 years of sedimentation, the total numbers and frequency of morphological abnormalities among M. barleeanus revealed some correlation with heavy metals concentrations (up to r2=79%). We conclude that abnormalities among foraminifera may represent a useful biomarker for evaluating trends in the biological impact resulting of submarine tailings disposal as well as long-term environmental impact and subsequent recovery.

AB  - Acid mine drainage has acidified large volumes of water and added high concentrations of dissolved heavy metals to West Squaw Creek, a California stream draining igneous rocks of low acid-neutralizing capacity. During mixing of the acid sulfate stream waters in the South Fork of West Squaw Creek with an almost equal volume of dilute uncontaminated water, Cu, Zn, Mn, and Al remained in solution rather than precipitating or adsorbing on solid phases. Changes in the concentration of these generally conservative metals could be used to determine relative flow volumes of acid tributaries and the main stream. An amorphous orange precipitate (probably ferric hydroxides or a mixture of ferric hydroxides and jarosite) was ubiquitous in the acid stream beds and was intimately associated with algae at the most acid sites. Relative sorption of cations decreased with decreasing water pH. However, arsenic was almost completely scavenged from solution within a short distance from the sulfide sources.

AB  - Otoliths from arctic char recovered from the water body formed from an abandoned open-pit nickel copper mine contain a trace element record related to the geology of the immediate watershed, past mining activity in the area, and the fish's diet. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometric analyses across the annular structure of the otoliths detected trace amounts of nickel, copper, and chromium believed to be related to the metal-bearing, mafic-ultramafic minerals in the pit. Oscillatory strontium, barium, and zinc profiles may reflect changing water temperature, diet, or fish metabolism. Lead was detected in very low concentrations and may be related to anthropogenic influence. This closed lake system provides a unique opportunity to study an introduced exotic species in a setting where neither migration nor recruitment have been possible. The fish have successfully occupied the lake and continue to breed despite the influence of the surrounding rocks and local contamination. The chemical record retained within otoliths provides a method of monitoring trace elements affecting fish on a yearly basis and may be regarded as a useful assessment tool for examining the exposure of wild organisms to trace elements.

AB  - Unemployment is considered to be a public health concern since deterioration in the hearth of the unemployed is often anticipated. However, for some groups, such as miners, unemployment might improve health due to a cessation of potentially harmful occupational exposures. This study evaluates the health of 79 miners in one Swedish iron-ore mine, and 226 age-matched controls from the general population, during one year after the closure of the mine. The participants received a questionnaire regarding medical history and subjective symptoms at the beginning of the study period, and after one year. Statistically significant negative effects on self-reported health attributable to unemployment were not found, although neuropsychiatric symptoms were more common among the unemployed miners. The miners reported a statistically significant improvement in grip force (p = 0.031). They had a significantly higher prevalence of symptoms associated with mining related exposures when compared with the population controls; pain in the upper extremities [relative risk (RR) = 2.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.44-3.59), back pain (RR = 1.84; CI = 1.23-2.75), vasospastic disease of the fingers (RR = 2.05; CI = 1.18-3.57) and obstructive respiratory symptoms (attacks of dyspnea and wheezing: RR = 3.67; CI = 1.16-11.6).

AB  - Overland transport of ore concentrate from the Red Dog lead/zinc mine in northwest Alaska to its seaport has historically raised concerns among local subsistence users regarding the potential impacts of fugitive dust from the operation, including the potential uptake of metals into caribou meat. Caribou are an integral part of life for northern Alaska Natives for both subsistence and cultural reasons. The Western Arctic caribou herd, whose range includes the Red Dog mine, transportation corridor, and port site, sometimes overwinter in the vicinity of mine operations. A weight of evidence approach using multiple lines of evidence was used to evaluate potential risks associated with subsistence consumption of caribou harvested near the road and mine. Data from a long term caribou monitoring program indicate a lack of consistent trends for either increasing or decreasing metals concentrations in caribou muscle, liver, and kidney tissue. Lead, cadmium, and zinc from all tissues were within the range of reference concentrations reported for caribou elsewhere in Northern Alaska. In addition, a site use study based on data from satellite-collared caribou from the Western Arctic Herd showed that caribou utilize the area near the road, port, and mine approximately 1/20th to 1/90th of the time assumed in a human health risk assessment conducted for the site, implying that risks were significantly overestimated in the risk assessment. The results from multiple lines of evidence consistently indicate that fugitive dust emissions from Red Dog Operations are not a significant source of metals in caribou, and that caribou remain safe for human consumption.

AB  - For decades, the mining sector has been a central economic driver in

the Canadian North, and the discovery of large diamond deposits in the

Northwest Territories has intensified the speed and scale of development. In

the wake of rapid expansion, researchers and communities have scrambled to

understand how individuals, families, culture, environment, livelihood, and

health might be affected by this industrial environment. There is a need to

understand the factors that contribute to positive and negative effects on individuals,

families, and communities.

This paper reviews some of the effects that mining industries can have on

well-being at the individual, family, and community levels in the Northwest

Territories, Canada’s fastest growing economy. It does not cover the universe

of impacts, but drills into a few effects in an effort to understand and build

up a model of resilience, which helps to explain how impacts are distributed,

experienced, and mediated. Resilience — the quality that helps communities

respond to change and moderate impact — is an under-researched area of

impact assessment. After describing the industry, we consider the question:

what factors affect whether an individual or community experiences the impact

from a mine? We call these “equity factors” and suggest they influence

how an impact is distributed across a population.

AB  - In widespread informal gold mining in the Amazon Basin, mercury is used to capture the gold particles as amalgam. Releases of mercury to the environment have resulted in the contamination of freshwater fish with methylmercury. In four comparable Amazonian communities, we examined 351 of 420 eligible children between 7 and 12 years of age. In three Tapajos villages with the highest exposures, more than 80% of 246 children had hair-mercury concentrations above 10 microg/g, a limit above which adverse effects on brain development are likely to occur. Neuropsychological tests of motor function, attention, and visuospatial performance showed decrements associated with the hair-mercury concentrations. Especially on the Santa Ana form board and the Stanford-Binet copying tests, similar associations were also apparent in the 105 children from the village with the lowest exposures, where all but two children had hair-mercury concentrations below 10 microg/g. Although average exposure levels may not have changed during recent years, prenatal exposure levels are unknown, and exact dose relationships cannot be generated from this cross-sectional study. However, the current mercury pollution seems sufficiently severe to cause adverse effects on brain development.

AB  - Juvenile mussels (Mytilus edulis) were transplanted to Howe Sound, British Columbia, Canada, along an apparent pollution gradient of acid mine drainage (AMD) from an abandoned copper (Cu) mine. Cages containing 75 mussels each were placed at a total of 15 stations and were exposed to concentrations of dissolved Cu in surface waters ranging from 5 to 1009 micrograms/l for a period of 41 days. Mussels located at stations closer to the source of AMD at the mouth of Britannia Creek bioaccumulated higher concentrations of Cu and zinc (Zn) in their tissues. Mussel growth was adversely affected by Cu tissue concentrations above 20 micrograms/g dry wt., while declines in survival and condition index occurred in mussels that bioaccumulated greater than 40 micrograms/g dry wt. Cu. Tissue Zn concentrations (117-192 micrograms/g dry wt.) were likely not high enough to have a direct impact on mussel health. Reduced survival of transplanted mussels was supported by an absence of natural mussels in contaminated areas. Phytoplankton was also severely reduced in areas contaminated by mine waters. Based on the weight of evidence, AMD from the Britannia mine had a deleterious impact on mussel survival in a zone extending at least 2.1 km to the north and 1.7 km to the south of Britannia Creek on the east shore of Howe Sound.

AB  - High precision lead isotope ratios in blood from 58 children aged 1–11 years from the Broken Hill lead mining community have been measured to determine the source and pathways of lead in their blood. Sources of lead are from the PbZnAg orebody (lead), from paint and from petrol. Thirty-five of the 58 children (60%) had blood leads (PbB) ≥ 0.72 μmol/l (15 μg/dl), the current level of ‘personal exposure and source remediation/abatement’ compared with a ‘background’ level of ∼0.29 μmol/l (6 μg/dl), estimated from adult females who were generally mothers of the children. Six of 17 children aged 7 years or older, had PbBs ≥ 0.72 μmol/l (15 μg/dl). Even though the orebody lead is the major contributor to PbB in Broken Hill children, of the 35 children whose PbB is ≥0.72 μm/l (15 μg/dl), 12 (34%) have ∼50% or more of their PbB derived from sources such as paint and petrol or both by isotopic identification. The identification of elevated PbB in older children is a concern, especially for females, as there is potential for release of endogenous lead during pregnancy and lactation.

AB  - The pollution status and total concentration of soil heavy metals were analyzed around tailing reservoir of Baotou and iron mining of Bayan Obo located in Inner Mongolia grassland ecosystem. Aim of the study is to control soil heavy metal pollution of grassland mining area and provide the basic information. The results indicated that the soils from different directions of the tailing reservoir were contaminated by Pb, Cu, Zn and Mn. According to the single factor pollution index, the pollution degree was Mn > Zn > Pb > Cu. According to Nemerow integrated pollution index, the indexes of the northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest of the tailing reservoir, were 2.43, 10.2, 1.88, 1.64. Soils from the southeast had the most serious heavy metal contamination because of the dominant wind of northwest. Within 50 m from the edge of tailing reservoir, heavy metal contamination was most serious except Cu. With regard to Bayan Obo iron mining, the single factor pollution index indicated that the soils from the six surveyed regions were contaminated by Pb, Cu, Zn and Mn. The integrated pollution index indicated that the indexes of the six regions, such as the mining area, the dump, outside the dump, outside the urban area, east region of the railway, and west region of the railway, were 14.3, 4.30, 2.69, 3.41, 2.88, and 2.20, respectively. The soil pollution degree of the mining area was the highest. Additionally, the transport of ore resulted in soil heavy metal pollution along railway. In general, soils of the two studied areas had the similar pollution characteristic, and the elements of heavy metal contamination were corresponding with the concentrations of tailings. The health and stabilization of grassland ecosystem are being threatened by soil heavy metals.

AB  - This paper reviews and assesses the state of data to describe and monitor mining

trends in the pan-Arctic and their social effects, and discusses drivers of change in

Arctic mining. Trends in mining activity can be characterized as stasis or decline

in mature regions of the Arctic, with strong growth in the frontier regions. World

prices and the availability of large, undiscovered and untapped resources with

favorable access and low political risk are the biggest drivers for Arctic mining,

while climate change is a minor and locally variable factor. The widely available

measures of mineral production and value are poor proxies for social and

economic effects on Arctic communities. Historical data on mineral production

and value are unavailable in electronic format for much of the Arctic, specifically

Scandinavia and Russia; completing the historical record back to 1980 will

require work with paper archives. The most critically needed improvement in

data collection and reporting is to develop comparable measures of employment.

The eight Arctic countries each use different definitions of employment and

different methodologies to collect the data. Furthermore, many countries do not

report employment by county and industry, so the Arctic share of mining

employment cannot be identified.

AB  - Heavy metal escapement associated with ore trucks is known to occur along the DeLong Mountain Regional Transportation System (DMTS) haul road corridor in Cape Krusenstern National Monument, northwest Alaska. Heavy metal concentrations in Hylocomium splendens moss (n = 226) were used in geostatistical models to predict the extent and pattern of atmospheric deposition of Cd and Ph on Monument lands. A stratified grid-based sample design was used with more intensive sampling near mine-related activity areas. Spatial predictions were used to produce maps of concentration patterns, and to estimate the total area in 10 moss concentration categories. Heavy metal levels in moss were highest immediately adjacent to the DMTS haul road (Cd > 24 mg/kg dw; Pb > 900 mg/kg dw). Spatial regression analyses indicated that heavy metal deposition decreased with the log of distance from the DMTS haul road and the DMTS port site. Analysis of subsurface soil suggested that observed patterns of heavy metal deposition reflected in moss were not attributable to subsurface lithology at the sample points. Further, moss Ph concentrations throughout the northern half of the study area were high relative to concentrations previously reported from other Arctic Alaska sites. Collectively, these findings indicate the presence of mine-related heavy metal deposition throughout the northern portion of Cape Krusenstern National Monument. Geospatial analyses suggest that the Pb depositional area extends 25 km north of the haul road to the Kisimilot/Iyikrok hills, and possibly beyond. More study is needed to determine whether higher moss heavy metal concentrations in the northernmost portion of the study area reflect deposition from mining-related activities, weathering from mineralized Pb/Zn outcrops in the broader region, or a combination of the two. South of the DMTS haul road, airborne deposition appears to be constrained by the Tahinichok Mountains. Heavy metal levels continue to diminish south of the mountains, reaching a minimum in the southernmost portion of the study area near the Igichuk Hills (45 km from the haul road). The influence of the mine site was not studied. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The concentration and possible sources of heavy metal input to a high Arctic mire in Kongsfjord, West Spitsbergen were examined; levels of lead, copper and zinc are highest in the surface humus closest to the carboniferous limestone cliff upon which seabirds nest. The concentrations of iron, manganese, nickel, copper, zinc and lead in two cores of peat increase markedly in the upper 5 cm of consolidated peat, with the highest concentrations found in the uppermost centimetre of peat. There has, therefore, been an increase in heavy metal loading to this High Arctic mire within the last 100 years. This cannot be attributed to the direct input of heavy metals from precipitation or coal dust from the local mines as the concentrations of the same elements in these materials are three orders of magnitude lower. It is only in the vicinity of seabird colonies that this pattern is shown and the concentrations (mu g g(-1) dry wt.) of lead, copper and zinc in faecal samples of kittiwake and glaucous gull are in the range 17-32, 35-65 and 63-260, respectively. The concentrations of these heavy metals in the faeces are close to those found in the surface layers of humus closest to the cliff. This indicates that the seabirds are acting as a vector for the movement of heavy metals between the marine and terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - The discharge of acid mine drainage (AMD) from the abandoned sulphur and copper mines at Avoca (S.E. Ireland) results in the formation of ochreous deposits on the river substrate. Sediment sampling was carried out intensively during June and August, 1994 and again during March and April, 1995 to investigate seasonal variation of Fe, Cu and Zn concentration in riverine sediments of the receiving water (Avoca River). Temporal and spatial variations indicate that, apart from pH, hydrological Factors play a major role in metal accumulation of highly energetic river systems. Zinc adsorption and desorption of 'ochre' is chiefly regulated by pH, while Cu removal seems to be primarily by co-precipitation with iron. Basic considerations with regard to sampling techniques are discussed. Copyright (C) 1996 IAWQ.

AB  - This paper explores the effects of human disturbances associated with mine development in the Arctic on habitat and populations of reindeer/caribou (both Rangifer tarandus), and implications for reindeer husbandry and caribou hunting of indigenous Sami people in Sweden and First Nations in Canada. Through three case studies, we illustrate how Cree and Naskapi communities develop community-based geospatial information tools to collect field data on caribou migration and habitat changes, and how Sami reindeer herders use GIS to gather information about reindeer husbandry to better communicate impacts of mining on reindeer grazing areas. Findings indicate impacts on the use of disturbed habitat by reindeer/caribou, on migration routes, and northern livelihoods. The three cases present novel methods for community-based environmental monitoring, with applications in hazards mapping and denote the active engagement of indigenous communities in polar environmental assessments, generating community-oriented data for land use management decisions. They also illustrate how technology can lead to better communication and its role for empowerment.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the following questions. (1) Is silica dust on its own, without the presence of silicosis, associated with an increased risk of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in workers exposed to silica dust? (2) In the absence of silicosis is the excess risk dose related? (3) What is the predominant chronological sequence between the development of PTB and the development of silicosis after the end of exposure to dust? METHODS: A cohort of 2255 white South African gold miners has been followed up from 1968 to 1971, when they were 45-55 years of age, to 31 December 1995 for the incidence of PTB. During the follow up 1592 (71%) men died. Of these, 1296 (81%) had a necropsy done at the National Centre for Occupational Health (NCOH) to determine the presence of silicosis and PTB. The incidence of PTB in the cohort was studied relative to cumulative exposure to dust and the onset of silicosis. For the miners with necropsy, the incidence for PTB was studied relative to the severity of silicosis found at necropsy. RESULTS: There were 115 subjects who developed PTB. The total person-years of follow up was 39,319. For the whole cohort, the factors associated with increased risk of PTB were cumulative exposure to dust (mg/m3.y) (the adjusted rate ratio (RR) 1.07; (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.04 to 1.10)), silicosis diagnosed radiologically (3.96 (2.59 to 6.06)), and tobacco pack-years (1.02 (1.01 to 1.03)). The RR (95% CI) for PTB increased with increasing quartiles of cumulative exposure to dust 1.0, 1.51 (0.78 to 2.91), 2.35 (1.28 to 4.32), and 3.22 (1.75 to 5.90). In miners who did not have radiologically diagnosed silicosis (n = 1934, PTB = 74), the adjusted RR (95% CI) for PTB and cumulative exposure to dust was 1.10 (1.06 to 1.13), and increased with quartiles of cumulative exposure to dust as 1.00, 1.46 (0.70 to 3.03), 2.67 (1.37 to 5.23), and 4.01 (2.04 to 7.88). For the subjects who had a necropsy (n = 1296, PTB = 70), the adjusted RR (95% CI) for PTB increased with the severity of silicosis found at necropsy; 1.0 for no silicosis, 1.88 (0.97 to 3.64) for negligible, 2.69 (1.35 to 5.37) for slight, and 2.30 (1.16 to 4.58) for moderate or marked silicosis. For subjects who had a necropsy and no silicosis (n = 577, PTB = 18), the adjusted RR (95% CI) increased slightly with quartiles of cumulative dust 1.0, 1.11 (0.31 to 4.00), 1.42 (0.43 to 4.72), and 1.38 (0.33 to 5.62). CONCLUSION: Exposure to silica dust is a risk factor for the development of PTB in the absence of silicosis, even after exposure to silica dust ends. The risk of PTB increases with the presence of silicosis, and in miners without radiological silicosis, with quartiles of exposure to dust. The severity of silicosis diagnosed at necropsy was associated with increasing risk of PTB and even < 5 nodules--that is, undetectable radiologically--was associated with an increased risk of PTB. The diagnosis of PTB was on average 7.6 years after the end of exposure to dust, at around 60 years of age. The onset of radiological silicosis preceded the diagnosis of PTB in 90.2% of the cases with PTB who had silicosis. The results have implications for medical surveillance of workers exposed to silica dust after the end of exposure.

AB  - Analysis of data from three contrasting northern resource developments showed differing patterns of psycho-social stresses on native populations. At Coppermine, many Inuit employees travelled to distant work sites with frequent rotations between home and work. Relatively few North Baffin Inuit travelled to the lead-zinc mine at Nanisivik for lengthy periods in camp. In contrast, the Syncrude developments in the Fort McMurray area affected native community life over a broad region and particularly in Fort MacKay. The Coppermine and Nanisivik experience indicated that rotation employment was the source of most disruptive impacts: whereas the experiences of Fort MacKay illustrated major negative impacts to communities in close proximity to major resource developments.

AB  - This paper reports on four years of employment of Inuit during the construction and the operations phase of the Nanisivik mine on Northern Baffin Island. A distinctive feature of this employment is that native employees must work for six weeks before taking a rest break at home, while employees from southern Canada have a work period twice that long. The employment records show that the Inuit turnover rate has been high, with many working no more than one or two months. However, their work performances have typically been rated as above average. Many workers reported that they liked their work activity and their work associates as well as the money that they earned, so that in many ways they experienced the mine employment positively. The interviews with workers and their wives showed clearly that while they wanted and needed the money to be earned at the mine, they did not like the lengthy absences of the men from home that this work necessitated. The wives were particularly negative toward this employment, complaining about meat shortages and other problems that they experienced during their husbands' absences. However, no evidence was found that any of the workers' home communities as a whole had experienced meat shortages due to the mine employment. It was concluded that the six week long work period confronts Inuit with a dilemma. On the one hand is their need for wage employment so that they can defray the increasingly heavy capital and operating costs associated with harvesting local natural resources, fish, fur and game. On the other hand, the long work imposed absences are in conflict with both the traditional closeness of the Inuit family, and the hunters' ingrained sense of responsibility to provide meat for their families. Resolution of these dilemmas, recruitment of higher proportions of Inuit workers, and reduction of their turnover rates and providing Inuit with increased employment opportunities and reduced welfare dependency will all depend upon reducing the length of the work period.

AB  - Because of their close relationships to the land, water, and resources therein, and their marginalized social and economic positions, Indigenous peoples living in current or former settler colonies are particularly vulnerable to mining's impacts, yet have the potential to benefit from its opportunities as well. This paper reviews the literature on large-scale mining projects' relationships to Indigenous peoples in post/colonial contexts, focusing on Australia, Canada, Finland, Greenland, New Caledonia, Norway, and Sweden, in the aim of generating insights from comparative perspectives. First, we discuss differences in legal regimes governing Indigenous peoples' rights and implications of those rights for negotiations over mining projects. Next, we examine, in turn, mining activities' various impacts - environmental, economic, social - and how they specifically affect Indigenous communities. Finally, we explore ways that Indigenous communities living in a post/colonial context have addressed large-scale mining projects' impacts by engaging with them, through both negotiation and resistance. We conclude by summarizing our findings on the relationships of Indigenous peoples to large-scale mining projects in the focus countries and identifying what gaps remain in the literature, and we provide thoughts as to how future research could address those gaps.

AB  - In Greenland, mining started as early as the 1850s and has taken place for copper, graphite, coal, cryolite, lead, zinc, and silver, but at present no mines are in operation. Environmental protection in connection with these operations was not an issue dealt with until the early 1970s, when the largest mine in Greenland was to start operating. Since then a legal framework has been developed for environmental protection in connection with exploration and exploitation of minerals in Greenland with standards similar to those used in North America and Western Europe. Monitoring and assessment of environmental impacts have been part of this process, in which the authors of this chapter have been deeply involved.

AB  - The article compares decision-making on two mining projects in Sami reindeer pastures: the Nussir and Biedjovaggi initiatives in northern Norway. Key actors are reindeer pastoralists, mining companies, local politicians and the state. Based on interviews, government documents, media debates and observations of meetings between the actors, the study examines the actors' claim to land and rationalities used in political decision-making. The case comparison shows that the actor groups used similar reasoning for claiming land. The mining companies argued that mining responded to local, national and global objectives and win-win opportunities of coexistence. The pastoralists referred to their customary rights to pastures and mining as threats to their livelihoods. In the Nussir case, the politicians approved the project based on environmental assessments, public hearings and the wellbeing of society. Their assumption was that conflicting interests could be solved through dialogue. However, the decision-making process ignored the contested rationalities and power relations in land-use conflict. In the Biedjovaggi case, local politicians rejected the initiative at an early stage. Here, the mining proposal initiated a debate about identity and ethics. In both cases, politics of belonging influenced the public recognition of the pastoralists' claim to land.

AB  - The objective of this study is to investigate the extent and degree of heavy metal contamination of paddy fields influenced by metalliferous mining activity. Paddy soils, rice plants and irrigation waters were sampled along six traverse lines in the vicinity of the mine and nearby control site. Soil samples were taken 30, 80 and 150 days after rice transplanting, to study seasonal variation of their chemical properties and heavy metal concentrations. Sampling of rice plants and irrigation waters was also undertaken with seasons. The analysis of the samples were carried out using ICP-AES for 25 elements including Cd, Cu, Ph and Zn. Physical and chemical properties of soils (pH, loss-on-ignition, cation exchange capacity and texture) and waters (pH, Eh and temperature) were also measured. The properties of soils were similar to the average Korean soils, with the exception of some samples taken in the vicinity of the mine. Concentrations of Cd, Cu, Ph and Zn in paddy soils, rice plants and irrigation waters sampled in the immediate vicinity of the mine were relatively high due to the seepage of metals from mining dump sites. Although there was variation between sampling sites, soil pH values under reducing conditions were on average higher than those under oxidising conditions. Relatively low content of organic matter and low cation exchange capacity of soils were found at 80 days after rice transplanting (P<0.05). No seasonal variations in metal concentrations were found in paddy soils throughout the period of the rice growing, in which soils ranged from flooded reducing conditions through most of the growing season to drained oxidising conditions before and at harvest. Relatively high metal concentrations were found in the rice stalks and leaves under oxidising conditions. The sequential extraction analysis of selected soil samples confirmed that high proportions of exchangeable fractions of the metals were found under oxidising conditions. It was shown that Cd and Zn concentrations in rice leaves and stalks and rice grain increased with increasing metal concentrations in paddy soils to a greater extent than for Cu and Pb. This difference in uptake is in agreement with the greater proportions of Cd and Zn, compared with Cu and Ph, in the exchangeable soil fraction extracted with MgCl4. Average daily intake from locally grown rice by the residents was estimated to be 121 mu g Cd and 126 mu g Pb. Thus, long-term metal exposure by regular consumption of the rice poses potential health problems to residents in the vicinity of the mine, although no adverse health effects have as yet been observed.

AB  - The Arctic region is increasingly viewed as an important resource-base, and is being explored for its resource development potential. While many researchers in the 1960s suggested that northern populations would eventually transition from a traditional, subsistence-dominated economy to a modern, wage-based economy, more recent studies reveal that the traditional economy remains important, desirable, and of benefit to northern individuals and communities. In this thesis I explore the relationship between traditional and modern economic activities related to one resource-based sector in the Arctic, the mining sector. Specifically, I explore the relationship between northern mining developments and subsistence activities and values in two Arctic regions, Canada's Nunavik region in the Province of Quebec and the United States' Northwest Arctic Borough in the State of Alaska. The purpose of this study is to answer the following question: does mining development in the Arctic lead to an increase or decrease in the importance of land-based subsistence participation and activities of local indigenous peoples. This study draws upon recent data that was collected in the Survey of Living Conditions in the Arctic (SLICA), an international project that comparatively studies aspects of living conditions for the Inuit, Inupiat, Saami, and Indigenous peoples of Chukotka. Four mining projects are utilized as case studies in this project, in order to help explain the findings from the results of the SLICA analysis. Two of these projects are currently in full operation, and two are presently in planning and approval phases. In Nunavik, the Raglan Mine and the proposed Raglan South Nickel Project are examined, and in Alaska, the Red Dog Mine, and its proposed Aqqaluk Project expansion are addressed.

AB  - A cohort of 54,128 men who worked in Ontario mines was observed for mortality between 1955 and 1986. Most of these men worked in nickel, gold, or uranium mines; a few worked in silver, iron, lead/zinc, or other ore mines. If mortality that occurred after a man had started to mine uranium was excluded, an excess of carcinoma of the lung was found among the 13,603 Ontario gold miners in the study (standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 129, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 115-145) and in men who began to mine nickel before 1936 (SMR 141, 95% CI 105-184). The excess mortality from lung cancer in the gold miners was confined to men who began gold mining before 1946. No increase in the mortality from carcinoma of the lung was evident in men who began mining gold after the end of 1945, in men who began mining nickel after 1936, or in men who mined ores other than gold, nickel, and uranium. In the gold mines each year of employment before the end of 1945 was associated with a 6.5% increase in mortality from lung cancer 20 or more years after the miner began working the mines (95% CI 1.6-11.4%); each year of employment before the end of 1945 in mines in which the host rock contained 0.1% arsenic was associated with a 3.1% increase in lung cancer 20 years or more after exposure began (95% CI 1.1-5.1%); and each working level month of exposure to radon decay products was associated with a 1.2% increase in mortality from lung cancer five or more years after exposure began (95% CI 0.02-2.4%). A comparison of two models shows that the excess of lung cancer mortality in Ontario gold miners is associated with exposure to high dust concentrations before 1946, with exposure to arsenic before 1946, and with exposure to radon decay products. No association between the increased incidence of carcinoma of the lung in Ontario gold miners and exposure to mineral fibre could be detected. It is concluded that the excess of carcinoma of the lung in Ontario gold miners is probably due to exposure to arsenic and radon decay products.

AB  - Lead and zinc levels in sediments and biota from the fjord system surrounding the lead/zinc mine at Maarmorilik, West Greenland, were investigated to evaluate the impact of waste rock and marine-deposited tailings on the marine biota. Concentrations of metal in the sediment were up to 8922+/-622 mug g(-1) (dry wt.) for lead and 19351+/-476 mug g(-1) (dry wt.) for zinc. Levels of lead and zinc were also elevated in a suite of monitor organisms. The feeding modes of the organisms were used to explain the sources of metals to the organisms. After closure of the mine, the concentrations of metals in the upper centimetres of the sediments decreased, and a decreased impact of metals on the brown alga Fucus distichus was observed. However, the metals in the sediments still affect the marine biota in the area. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In 1985, the collapse of the tailing dam in Chenzhou lead/zinc mine (Hunan, southern China) led to the spread of mining waste spills on the farmland along the Dong River. After the accident, an urgent soil cleaning up was carried out in some places. Seventeen years later, cereal (rice, maize, and sorghum), pulses (soybean, Adzuki bean, mung bean and peanut), vegetables (ipomoea, capsicum, taro and string bean) and the rooted soils were sampled at four sites: (1) the mining area (SZY), (2) the area still covered with the mining tailing spills (GYB), (3) the cleaned area from mining tailing spills (JTC), and (4) a background site (REF). Metal concentrations in the crops and soils were analyzed to evaluate the long-term effects of the spilled waste on the soil and the potential human exposure through food chains. The results showed that the physical-chemical properties of the soils obviously changed due to the different farming styles used by each individual farmer. Leaching effects and plant extraction of metals from some soils were quite weak. Certain soils were still heavily polluted with As, Cd, Zn, Pb and Cu. The contamination levels were in the order of GYB>SZY>JTC showing that the clean-up treatment was effective. The maximum allowable concentration (MAC) levels for Chinese agricultural soils were still highly exceeded, particularly for As and Cd (followed by Zn, Pb and Cu), with mean concentrations of 709 and 7.6 mg kg(-1), respectively. These concentrations exceed the MAC levels by 24 times for As and 13 times for Cd at GYB. Generally, the edible leaves or stems of crops were more heavily contaminated than seeds or fruits. Ipomoea was the most severely contaminated crop. The concentrations of Cd and Pb were 3.30 and 76.9 mg kg(-1) in ipomoea leaves at GYB, which exceeded the maximum permit levels (0.5 mg kg(-1) for Cd and 9 mg kg(-1) for Pb) by 6.6 and 8.5 times, respectively. Taro (+skin) could accumulate high concentrations of Zn and Cd in the edible stem, and rice and capsicum had high Cd concentration in the edible parts. However, the toxic element concentrations in maize, sorghum, Adzuki bean, soybean and mung bean remained lower than the threshold levels. The bio-accumulation factors (BAFs) of crops were in the order: Cd>Zn>Cu>Pb>As. BAF was typically lower in the edible seeds or fruits than in stems and leaves. The accumulation effect strongly depends on the crop's physiological properties, the mobility, of the metals, and the availability of metals in soils but not entirely on the total element concentrations in the soils. Even so, the estimated daily intake amount of Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb from the crops grown in the affected three sites and arsenic at SZY and GYB exceeded the RDA (Recommended dietary allowance) levels. Subsequently, the crops grown in Chenzhou Pb/Zn mine waste affected area might have a hazardous effect on the consumer's health. This area still needs effective measures to cure the As, Cd, Pb, Zn and Cu contamination.

AB  - We analysed the benthic macroinvertebrate species composition, taxonomic richness (as expected richness for 100 individuals), total abundance and biomass at 117 stream sites in the province of Dalarna. Partial least squares regression models were constructed from observations on undisturbed sites and used to predict these community parameters at sites exposed to elevated levels of copper, zinc, lead and cadmium resulting from leakage from old mine deposits. Species richness at undisturbed sites was positively related to the size of the catchment, pH, channel width. calcium concentration and the proportion of deciduous trees in the riparian zone. In streams with elevated metal concentrations, we found reductions in taxonomic richness for total macroinvertebrates, mayflies, stoneflies and combined EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera). but not fur that of Trichoptera nor total abundance or biomass. Copper and zinc were those metals showing strongest negative associations with richness. Some ta,va, common at undisturbed sites, were missing at metal-polluted sites, These taxa were the mayflies Ameletus inopinatus, Ephemerella aurivilli and Heptagenia dalecarlica, the stonefly Protonemura meyeri and the caddisfly Apatania sp.

AB  - We studied the environmental effects of the mining activity of Troya Mine on the fluvial ecosystem, in the Basque Country, Spain, from 1993 to 1995. The multivariate analysis of the physicochemical conditions shows that the main abiotic factors of variation are: (i) in the water column, a significant increase in the content of heavy metals and conductivity, and (ii) an intense accumulation of heavy metals in the bottom sediments. We studied the effects of these factors on density, richness, dominance, similarity coefficient and composition of the benthic macroinvertebrate community (BMI).We observed a de-structuring of the community. Richness decreases (from 25 to 11 different number of families), but it does not suitably value the impact. Density oscillates radically (255–1548 individuals m-2) and reflects changes occurred in sediments. Dominance, which oscillates from 0 to 1, increase from 0.16 upstream from the mine, to 0.42 downstream, fundamentally due to oscillations of Chironomidae, Tubificidae, Baetidae and Simuliidae. The similarity coefficient indicates the physicochemical variations both in the sediment and in the water column; this index is therefore suitable for the follow-up of the evolution of the disturbance studied. The families sensitive to disturbance in the water column are: Ephemeridae, Athericidae, Sericostomatidae, Leptophlebiidae, Baetidae, Gammaridae, Perlidae, Heptageniidae, and Leptoceridae; the tolerant ones are: Coenagrionidae, Hydrobiidae, Lumbricidae, and Polycentropodidae.With regard to the metal content in sediments, the sensitive families are: Gammaridae, Ephemeridae and Ceratopogonidae; the tolerant ones are: Simuliidae, Culicidae, Hydrophilidae, Dolichopodidae, Chironomidae, Psychodidae, Tipulidae, and Chrysomelidae.We thus synthesized the complexity inherent to this type of pollution, in which large amounts of variables are normally involved.

AB  - A presentation is made of the study of an underground polymetallic sulphide mine and the pollution caused by this in the adjoining aquatic ecosystems. Troya Mine is in the Basque Cantabrian region (northern Spain). The annual production of the ore deposit of over 3.7 million tons of Pb (0.9%), Zn (11.2%) and Cu (0.2%) was 300,000 t. It was open and producing from 1986-1993. The mineralization was made up of pyrite, marcasite, sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite and arsenopyrite. Only the Zn and the Pb were mined. We studied the distribution and behaviour of the heavy metals Zn, Pb, Fe, Mn, Cu, Cr and Cd in the water column, dissolved and suspended fractions, and in the sediments of Estanda Stream and of Gezala Creek. Zn, Cd and Mn tend to be found in the water; Fe, Pb, Cu and Cr appear as an adsorbed fractionin the solid phases. Those of the second group are significantly linked to the fluvial sediments and present very high levels. The concentrations of the metals are conditioned by the waters from the mine galleries, by the leached waste, by the surface runoff, and by overflow from the spillway of the tailings pond. Our observations provide knowledge on the extent of the polluting power of the metals, the physico-chemical effects in play and the subsequent chances of recovering these highly affected environments.

AB  - A cross-sectional survey of the work force at an iron ore surface mine and beneficiation plant in Labrador identified cases with a radiologic diagnosis compatible with simple pneumoconiosis by the International Labour Organization (ILO) classification (1980). Their distribution by ILO categories 1, 2, and 3, after excluding those with confounding diagnoses for pneumoconiosis, was 30, 10, and 2 cases, respectively. ILO category was related to age, duration of current employment, and cumulative respirable dust and quartz levels, as well as to decrement in ventilatory function.

AB  - Data are presented which evaluate the performance of a pilot-scale treatment system using pelletised hydrous ferric oxide (HFO; a waste stream from coal mine water treatment) as a high surface area sorbent for removing zinc (Zn) from a metal mine water discharge in the North Pennines Orefield, UK. Over a 10-month period the system removed Zn at mean area- and volume-adjusted removal rates of 3.7 and 8.1 g m(-3) day(-1), respectively, with a mean treatment efficiency of 32% at a low mean residence time of 49 min. There were seasonal effects in Zn removal owing to establishment and dieback of algae in the treatment tank. This led to increased Zn uptake in early summer months followed by slight Zn release upon algae senescence. In addition to these biosorptive processes, the principal sinks for Zn appear to be (1) sorption onto the HFO surface. and (2) precipitation with calcite-dominated secondary minerals. The latter were formed as a product of dissolution of portlandite in the cement binder and calcium recarbonation. Further optimisation of the HFO pelletisation process holds the possibility for providing a low-cost, low footprint treatment option for metal rich mine waters, in addition to a valuable after-use for recovered HFO from coal mine water treatment facilities.

AB  - In October, 1990 the Missouri Department of Health entered a contract with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) to conduct an exposure study at the Jasper County, Missouri Superfund Site. The primary concern was exposure to elevated levels of lead and cadmium resulting from previous mining of lead and zinc in the area. Several individuals were found to have elevated lead levels and this article is a case study of two households where children with elevated levels resided. Due to the lowering of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) standard for a level of concern in childhood lead poisoning from 25 µg/dl to 10 µg/dl, many environmental health personnel may be requested to evaluate exposure routes and give advice regarding risk reduction to families who reside in areas not previously thought to be problematic. Accomplishing this risk reduction may require passage of local ordinances requiring lead abatement, additional training of field personnel, and cooperative work with other public and governmental entities.

AB  - Throughout the Euro-Arctic region of Russia (Murmansk region), there is a substantial increase of metal concentrations in water, which are related to local discharges from the metallurgical and mining industry, transboundary pollution, as well as indirect leaching of elements by acid precipitation. This study collates data to investigate the relationship between surface water contamination by metals, and fish and human health. Fish are used as a biological indicator to show the impact of water pollution by metals on the ecosystem's health. The etiology of fish and human diseases are related to the water pollution and accumulation of metals in organisms. High concentrations of Ni and Cd in water drives an accumulation of these elements in organs and tissues of fish, especially in kidneys. The relation between the accumulation of Ni in kidneys and the development of fish nephrocalcinosis and fibroelastosis was established. Statistical analysis demonstrated that human populations in cities close in proximity to smelters show the highest incidence of disease. The results of histological, clinical, and post-mortem examination of patients shows the highest content of toxic metals, especially Cd, in livers and kidneys. Our complex investigation of a set of disorders observed in fish and human populations indicates that there is a high probability that the negative impact on human health is caused by prolonged water contamination by heavy metals. As a novel finding, this paper shows that based on the similarity of pathological processes and bioaccumulation of metals in fish and humans, examining the content of heavy metals in fish can be used to confirm etiology and evaluate the potential risk to human health by pollution of surface waters.

AB  - Spatial patterns of Zn, Pb and Cd deposition in Cape Krusenstern National Monument (CAKR), Alaska, adjacent to the Red Dog Mine haul road, were characterized in 2001 and 2006 using Hylocomium moss tissue as a biomonitor. Elevated concentrations of Cd, Pb, and Zn in moss tissue decreased logarithmically away from the haul road and the marine port. The metals concentrations in the two years were compared using Bayesian posterior predictions on a new sampling grid to which both data sets were fit. Posterior predictions were simulated 200 times both on a coarse grid of 2,357 points and by distance-based strata including subsets of these points. Compared to 2001, Zn and Pb concentrations in 2006 were 31 to 54% lower in the 3 sampling strata closest to the haul road (0-100, 100-2000 and 2000-4000 m). Pb decreased by 40% in the stratum 4,000-5,000 m from the haul road. Cd decreased significantly by 38% immediately adjacent to the road (0-100m), had an 89% probability of a small decrease 100-2000 m from the road, and showed moderate probabilities (56-71%) for increase at greater distances. There was no significant change over time (with probabilities all <= 85%) for any of the 3 elements in more distant reference areas (40-60 km). As in 2001, elemental concentrations in 2006 were higher on the north side of the road. Reductions in deposition have followed a large investment in infrastructure to control fugitive dust escapement at the mine and port sites, operational controls, and road dust mitigation. Fugitive dust escapement, while much reduced, is still resulting in elevated concentrations of Zn, Pb and Cd out to 5,000 m from the haul road. Zn and Pb levels were slightly above arctic baseline values in southern CAKR reference areas.

AB  - This study focuses on heavy metal contamination of arctic sediments from a small Fjord system adjacent to the Pb-Zn "Black Angel" mine (West Greenland) to investigate the temporal and spatial development of contamination and to provide baseline levels before the mines re-opening in January 2009. For this purpose we collected multi-cores along a transect from Affarlikassaa Fjord, which received high amounts of tailings from 1973 to 1990, to the mouth of Qaumarujuk Fjord. Along with radiochemical dating by Pb-210 and Cs-137, geochemical analyses of heavy metals (e.g. As, Cd, Hg, Pb, and Zn) were carried out. Maximum contents were found at 12 cm depth in Affarlikassaa. After 17 years the mine last closed, specific local hydrographic conditions continue to disperse heavy metal enriched material derived from the Affarlikassaa into Qaumarujuk. Total Hg profiles from multi-cores along the transect clearly illustrate this transport and spatial distribution pattern of the contaminated material. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work is part of a research effort which is intended to identify natural and anthropogenic sources for metal contamination in gold and copper mining areas of the Camaqua River Basin, located in the shield region of the Rio Grande do Sul state. This particular study area is located in the upper Camaqua River Basin, where gold, copper and marble occurs. Stream bed sediments were collected during four sampling periods, between 1992 and 1994. Total Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb and Hg concentrations as well as TOC contents were determined in the silt-clay fraction of all collected samples. Sequential extractions were performed in some selected samples to evaluate geochemical phase associations and potential metal mobilities. A general increase in metal concentrations was observed in more recent sampling periods for Mn, Fe and Cu, especially in the copper mining area. Two groups of metals, Cu-Fe and Hg-Pb-Zn-Mn, presented some similarities in spatial distributions, but exhibited different geochemic behaviors in the gold and copper mining areas.

AB  - The Viburnum Trend lead-zinc mining subdistrict is located in the southeast Missouri portion of the Ozark Plateau. In 2003 and 2004, we assessed the ecological effects of mining in several watersheds in the region. We included macroinvertebrate surveys, habitat assessments, and analysis of metals in sediment, pore water, and aquatic biota. Macroinvertebrates were sampled at 21 sites to determine aquatic life impairment status (full, partial, or nonsupport) and relative biotic condition scores. Macroinvertebrate biotic condition scores were significantly correlated with cadmium, nickel, lead, zinc, and specific conductance in 2003 (r = -0.61 to -0.68) and with cadmium, lead, and pore water toxic units in 2004 (r = -0.55 to -0.57). Reference sites were fully supporting of aquatic life and had the lowest metals concentrations and among the highest biotic condition scores in both years. Sites directly downstream from mining and related activities were partially supporting, with biotic condition scores 10% to 58% lower than reference sites. Sites located greater distances downstream from mining activities had intermediate scores and concentrations of metals. Results indicate that elevated concentrations of metals originating from mining activities were the underlying cause of aquatic life impairment in several of the streams studied. There was general concurrence among the adversely affected sites in how the various indicators responded to mining activities during the overall study.

AB  - Future development in the Arctic and Subarctic region requires careful attention to the possible consequences of the development activities themselves, in relation to their environmental, socioeconomic and cultural impacts. A more thorough understanding of the impact of future activities, however, demands the dissemination and confrontation of results from different regions and different scientific traditions. This requires scientific cooperation, not only across disciplines but across border. Primarily it requires both consensus and innovations in regard to methods. This book confronts such differences in approaches and methods in relation to the analysis of socioeconomic and environmental consequences of large-scale mineral and energy development activities in the Arctic and Subarctic, establishing the common ground upon which future research activities can be based.

AB  - In this article, we examine whether the social and economic impacts of mines on Inuit communities have changed over time, based on Inuit experiences. After an overview of the past experiences of Inuit with the mining industry in Inuit Nunangat between 1957 and the early 2000s, we analyze the complex relation between Inuit communities in the vicinity of mines using recent fieldwork conducted in the Inuit communities located near two active mines in Inuit Nunangat: Salluit and Kangiqsujuaq (Nunavik) and the Raglan nickel mine and Qamani'tuaq (Baker Lake, Nunavut) and the Meadowbank gold mine. We argue that much work remains to be done to understand the economic and social impacts of mining development on Inuit communities.

AB  - Mercury exposure and health status were examined in 40 gold workers in the area surrounding El Callao, Venezuela. Concentrations of mercury in workplace air were measured on 3 successive days, and spot urine and hair samples were also taken for analysis. Subjects underwent a physical examination and completed a questionnaire regarding employment history, work activities involving mercury exposure, use of protective clothing and equipment, and frequency of 37 symptoms associated with mercury toxicity. A complete set of health data was collected for 29 of the subjects. Use of protective equipment was limited, and 17.9%, 24.1%, and 48.3% of subjects had mercury concentrations in air, hair, and urine, respectively, above contemporary occupational exposure guidelines. Physical examination found the workers to be generally healthy and without overt symptoms of mercury toxicity. The frequency of psychoneurological, gastrointestinal, cardio-respiratory, and dermal symptoms was unrelated to any of the measures of mercury exposure. Two subjects had modestly elevated urinary levels of N-acetyl beta-D-glucosaminidase. Despite substantial occupational exposure to mercury among a number of the subjects, few adverse health effects were observed that were plausibly related to mercury.

AB  - Soil, aquatic biota (moss: Brachythecium rivulare; aquatic macrophytes: Juncus effusus, Potamogeton crispus; fish: Salmo trutta fario, Anguilla anguilla, Phoxinus phoxinus, Chelon labrosus) and sediment samples from the Urumea river valley were analysed for metals by acid digestion and atomic absorption spectroscopy. The sediments show the presence of metal pollution (Cd: 2.5-24 mg kg(-1); Pb: 125-1,150 mg kg(-1); Zn: 125-2,500 mg kg(-1)) because mining and industrial wastes. A selective retention of dense minerals in dam sediments contributes to the load of metal, but interstitial water analysis (Cd: <0.02-0.1 mg L-1; ph: 0.3-1.0 mg L-1; Zn: <0.05-0.6 mg L-1) shows that precipitation equilibrium controls their mobilisation. Biota samples show evidence of metal accumulation, moss reaching 1,100 mg kg(-1) in lead and 6,800 mg kg(-1) in zinc. Soil from the valley is polluted by both, river carried material and industrial sources (Cd: 1.0-4.0 mg kg(-1): ph. 26-1,120 mg kg(-1); Zn: 105-1,390 mg kg(-1)), but they are used, indistinctly, for farming and pasture.

AB  - The potential effects of proposed lead-zinc mining in an ecologically sensitive area were assessed by studying a nearby mining district that has been exploited for about 30yr under contemporary environmental regulations and with modern technology. Blood and liver samples representing fish of three species (largescale stoneroller, Campostoma oligolepis, n = 91; longear sunfish, Lepomis megalotis, n = 105; and northern hog sucker, Hypentelium nigricans, n = 20) were collected from 16 sites representing a range of conditions relative to lead-zinc mining and ore beneficiation in southeastern Missouri. Samples were analyzed for lead, zinc, and cadmium, and for a suite of biomarkers (reported in a companion paper). A subset of the hog sucker (n = 9) representing three sites were also analyzed for nickel and cobalt. Blood and liver lead concentrations were highly correlated (r = 0.84-0.85, P < 0.01) in all three species and were significantly (ANOVA, P < 0.01) greater at sites < 10 km downstream of active lead-zinc mines and mills and in a historical lead zinc mining area than at reference sites, including a site in the area proposed for new mining. Correlations between blood and liver cadmium concentrations were less evident than for lead but were nevertheless statistically significant (r = 0.26-0.69, P < 0.01-0.07). Although blood and liver cadmium concentrations were highest in all three species at sites near mines, within-site variability was greater and mining-related trends were less evident than for lead. Blood and liver zinc concentrations were significantly correlated only in stoneroller (r = 0.46, P < 0.01) and mining-related trends were not evident. Concentrations of cobalt and nickel in blood and liver were significantly higher (ANOVA, P < 0.01) at a site near an active mine than at a reference site and a site in the historical lead-zinc mining area. These findings confirm previous studies indicating that lead and other metals are released to streams from active lead-zinc mines and are available for uptake by aquatic organisms.

AB  - Identification of mining-related contaminants is important in order to assess the spreading of contaminants from mining as well as for site remediation purposes. This study focuses on lead (Pb) contamination in biota near the abandoned ‘Black Angel Mine’ in West Greenland in the period 1988–2008. Stable Pb isotope ratios and total Pb concentrations were determined in lichens, seaweed and mussels as well as in marine sediments. The results show that natural background Pb (207Pb/206Pb: 0.704–0.767) and Pb originating from the mine ore (207Pb/206Pb: 0.955) have distinct isotopic fingerprints. Total Pb in lichens, seaweed, and mussels was measured at values up to 633, 19 and 1536 mg kg−1 dry weight, respectively, and is shown to be a mixture of natural Pb and ore-Pb. This enables quantification of mining-related Pb and shows that application of Pb isotope data is a valuable tool for monitoring mining pollution

AB  - Contamination by lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) was studied in seawater, sediments, seaweeds and blue mussels near the former Black Angel Pb-Zn Mine in Maarmorilik, West Greenland. The mine operated during the period 1973-90 when mine waste (tailings and later waste rock) was discharged directly into the sea. Metal concentrations peaked during the mining period and Pb and Zn in seawater within the discharge area were measured up to 440 and 790 mug L(-)(1), respectively. Pb in fiord sediments, seaweeds and blue mussels just outside the discharge area were measured in concentrations up to 190, 84 and 2650 and Zn up to 300, 360 and 1190 mug g(-)(1) dry wt., respectively. Within the discharge area, seawater metal concentrations (especially Pb) decreased abruptly after mine closure. Metals concentrations in sediments and biota, however, decreased more slowly and two decades after mine closure seaweeds and blue mussels were still contaminated 12 km from the mine.

AB  - Lapland, the northernmost county of Finland, has promising mineral deposits and over half of all Finnish mining operations. In the 2000s two new metallic mineral mines were opened in Lapland, while three projects are undergoing the environmental impact assessment procedure (EIA). This process also involves a social impact assessment (SIA) that reports on the expected impacts of mining on the host communities. SIAs influence the permit process and the ensuing activity and officially represent the views of the local people in the planning and decision-making process. 

In this study, social impact assessments are examined by discourse analysis introduced by Maarten Hajer. The document analysis identified three recurrent story lines shared by all the investigated SIAs. A story line combines elements from different domains and suggests a common understanding on an issue. The second phase of the discourse analysis was to analyse these story lines in the context they were produced. 

The first story line sees mines as the only way to develop the remote regions of Lapland. Large-scale mining projects are seen as a solution to economic problems, unemployment and out-migration. The second story line stresses the importance of mines in supporting the “general interest” of the whole province. After the Second World War, the intensive use of natural resources was justified by national interests; now it is justified by the interests of the region. The third story line argues that nature has no intrinsic value – it is merely a resource to be used. With the help of such story lines, SIAs grant the right to mine in Lapland.

AB  - Mercury contamination associated with small-scale gold mining and processing represents a major environmental and human health concern in Eastern and Southern Africa. Approximately 200 000–300 000 persons are involved in small-scale gold mining activities in Tanzania and >200 000 persons in Zimbabwe. Mercury (Hg) is used mainly for the processing of primary gold quartz veins and supergene gold mineralizations. Gravimetric material flow analyses show that 70–80% of the Hg is lost to the atmosphere during processing, 20–30% are lost to tailings, soils, stream sediments and water. For every 1 g Au produced, 1.2–1.5 g Hg are lost to the environment. Cumulatively, the anthropogenic Hg released annually into the atmosphere is approximately 3–4 t in the whole Lake Victoria Goldfields of Tanzania and >3 t in Zimbabwe. Tailings are local ‘hot spots’ with high concentrations of As, Pb, Cu and Hg. Lateral and vertical dispersion of Hg lost to soils and stream sediments is very limited (laterally <260 m, vertically <20 cm). Dispersion of mercury from tailings is low because Hg is transported largely in the elemental, metallic form. In addition, Fe-oxide rich laterites and swamps appear to be natural barriers for the dispersion of metals in soils and streams. Ground and surface water quality data indicate very low dispersion rates during the dry season.

AB  - In northern Tanzania large numbers of small scale miners use mercury in the gold extraction process causing contamination of the environment and risks to human health. Human exposure to Hg was assessed in populations in and around small scale gold mining camps by means of human hair and urine surveys. We also determined Hg concentration in fish in aquatic bodies close to these camps. Urinary Hg testing in three communities showed that 36% of the gold miners working with amalgam exceeded the WHO guideline concentration of 50 μg Hg/g creatinine. Data from a hair survey of fishermen and farmers confirm that at present, the fish-eating population close to the southern tip of Lake Victoria is at low risk with regard to Hg exposure. Concentrations in fish were low and >90% of the hair samples from the fish-eating population were below 2 μg/g T-Hg. Highest Hg concentrations in fish caught along the southern shores of Lake Victoria and in rivers draining from gold processing sites were detected in lungfish species (Protopterus aethiopicus), and lowest Hg concentrations in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus and Tilapia zilii).

AB  - The epidemic of HIV/AIDS is at an advanced stage in many African countries, but little attention has been given to the impact that this will have in industrial settings. Using the Southern African mining industry as a case study, the authors consider the state of the HIV epidemic and discuss programs that have been undertaken to manage HIV. They critically analyze the reasons current interventions have had little impact on HIV among mine workers, tracing the lack of success to neglect of the social and community contexts within which HIV transmission takes place, as well as the lack of attention to the psychosocial processes and mechanisms underlying disease transmission. Finally, they present an intervention that aims to address the limitations of existing industrial programs and improve the management of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV, in a particular occupational setting through creating alliances between a wide range of community stakeholders. The intervention aims not only to reduce STDs, promote awareness of HIV risks, and distribute condoms, as existing programs have done, but also to address the broader social, cultural, and community contexts that facilitate HIV transmission.

AB  - The lakes surrounding the iron ore mining region of Schefferville, Quebec, Canada, sit within a landscape of historical disturbances, two of which have been relatively well documented over time: metal contamination and nutrient loading. Based on the analysis of sediment cores, we used cladoceran zooplankton subfossil assemblages from two lakes located in Schefferville to track both alpha and beta diversity over the last 100+ years. We showed that high metal concentrations were correlated with decreased cladoceran diversity, and that the site that experienced both direct wastewater input and atmospheric metal loading (Lake Dauriat) had the greatest declines in cladoceran richness. In both lakes, turnover in cladoceran assemblages was highest in the mining period. During the period of mine closures and improvement of wastewater treatment, some decreases in metal enrichment in the sediments and increases in cladoceran richness were observed in Lake Dauriat. Overall, a combined use of species richness and beta diversity metrics showed alpha and beta diversity are not always congruent, and that there are various ways to interpret scenarios of temporal beta diversity in northern freshwater systems.

AB  - As its name indicates, Goldenville was a famous gold mining area in Nova Scotia where large quantities of mercury were used in the gold recovery process. It is estimated that the 3 million tons of tailings left from the mining activities which lasted from 1860 to 1945 contain 470 kg of Cd, 37 300 kg of Pb, 6800 kg of Hg, 20 700 kg of As and 2600 kg of Tl. Analysis of metal contents of stream water, stream and lake sediments, tailings, and vegetation show that the tailings have been distributed over time across the stream basin to form a tailing field of approximately 2 km(2). There is a continuous release of As, Hg, Pb, Tl and other metals from the tailing field, resulting in contamination of ecosystems downstream including the Gegogan Harbor of the Atlantic Ocean. Stream water and sediments of Lake Gegogan located downstream from the mine were found toxic to the benthic community. A loss of fish habitat was observed. Although the mines were closed over 50 years ago, sedimentary records of metal loadings into Lake Gegogan show that the release of metals from the tailings has not slowed down. Analysis of metal tolerant species in the area suggests that horsetails (Equisetum rubiaceae and E. sylvaticum) can be used in phytoremediation of sites contaminated with arsenic and mercury.

AB  - Soil, crop and residents' hair over Xiaoqinling gold mining region, China, which was selected as a case study, were sampled and analyzed for Hg, Cd, Pb, Cu, Cr, As and Zn concentrations. The concentrations of heavy metals in soil or crop and hair samples were used to assess their potential ecological risks, or to find the responses to these metals as evidences to prove the potential risk was coming down to observed harm, respectively. The results showed that, these metals in soil were ranked by severity of ecological risk as Hg>Cd>Pb>Cu>Cr>As>Zn, based on their single-element indexes. In the view of the potential ecological risk indexes, of all soil samples, about half had significantly high or high potential ecological risk, which covered more than 74% of the studied region. Most of the risks were 97.41% from Hg, Pb and Cd, especially, 84.37% from Hg. Both the single-element and potential ecological risk indexes indicated that, the ecological risk grades had a special spatial characteristic, and increased from northwest to southeast generally. This was agreed with the spatial distribution of the strength in gold mining activities over the studied region. The concentrations of Hg and Pb were higher than their relative backgrounds in the corps, and were even 9.48 and 25.09 times higher than their relative backgrounds in residents' hair, respectively. All these showed that the heavy metals in the soil had a high potential ecological risk, especially, had been affecting these crops' growing and yield, and even the residents' health through food strains. Obviously, these metals' potential ecological harm had been coming down to observed harm to the ecology.

AB  - The concentrations of heavy metals of soils were analyzed and their contaminations were studied in the Lala copper mine.The Lala copper mine is a seriously contaminated region by cadmium,copper and mercury but no contamination by chromium,lead and arsenic.The concentrations of mercury,cadmium and copper in soils in the Lala mine are as 13.4,19.5 and 4.9 times higher than the average background values of soils in China,respectively.Using the index of geoaccumulation developed by Muller,we found that soils in the Lala mine is seriously polluted by cadmium,heavily polluted by mercury and moderately polluted by copper,while the soils are not or moderately polluted by chromium with no pollution by lead and arsenic.The pollution intensity of soils in the Lala mine follows the order of CdHgCuCrPbAs.So not only soil contamination by copper,cadmium and mercury should be emphasized,but also zoological health effect should be taken into consideration.

AB  - Long-term impact of former mining activities on the marine sub-Arctic ecosystem in the Ivittuut area, Arsuk Fjord, South Greenland, was studied by transplantation experiments with the blue mussel Mytilus edulis. Measurements of metal concentration in mussels were conducted using atomic absorption spectrometry (flame AAS) and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (graphite furnace AAS). Uptake and release of Pb were documented to be slow processes. For mussels transplanted from the pristine Kugnait Bay to the polluted mining site at Ivittuut, a continuous accumulation throughout the experiments was found. Linear uptake rates of 5.86, 6.94 and 11.62 mu g Pb month(-1) for small, medium and large mussels were found for a 6-week experiment, whereas exponential uptake rates of 0.26, 0.20 and 0.28 month(-1) were found for a 9-month experiment. It is estimated that the transplanted mussels will reach the same level as the resident population 12-16 months following transplantation. Mussels transplanted from the polluted mining site at Ivittuut to the pristine Kugnait Bay depurated only 7-21% of their original Pb content, and the release was within the first 10 days following transplantation, after which the Pb content remained constant.
